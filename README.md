# Bicycle-mounted Vehicle Tracking System

## Software
This software include vehicle recognition using OpenCV (c++) and scripts (python) for running on startup and communication with an Adafruit Feather

Lane detection is commented out because of Zero's 1GHz processing

Lane detection provides a region of interest to search for vehicles. This allows for higher sensitivity in recognizing vehicles so that none are missed.

## Hardware
Raspberry Pi Zero

Adafruit Feather 32u4 Adalogger

Camera Module V2 by Raspberry Pi to improve image processing speeds
